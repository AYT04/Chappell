          "good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me, if you ever cared to ask", 
          "well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily, you found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks",
          "I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped, now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl",
          "maybe I'm too emotional, but your apathy's like a wound in salt. maybe I'm too emotional, or maybe you never cared at all",
          
          "and I'm so sick of seventeen, where's my fucking teenage dream? if someone tells me one more time 'enjoy your youth', I'm gonna cry",

          "you were so excited for me to finally drive up to your house, but today I drove through the suburbs crying 'cause you weren't around",
          "'cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street",
          "all my friends are tired of hearing how much I miss you, but I kinda feel sorry for them, 'cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah",
          
          "it took you two weeks to go off and date her, guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor",
          
          "you got me fucked up in the head, boy",
          "it's always one step forward and three steps back do you love me, want me, hate me, boy? I don't understand",

          "so when you gonna tell her, that we did that, too? she thinks it's special, but it's all reused",
          "that was our place, I found it first, I made the jokes, you tell to her when she's with you.", 
          "do you get déjà vu when she's with you?",
          "I know you get déjà vu",
