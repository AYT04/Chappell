# Ghost - Ava Max
"You're in my blood, and you're in my veins",
"And you're appearin' in every face",
"So outta earth, I'm in outer space",
"Caught up in my dreams, but I'm wide awake (ah-ah-ah)",
"Footsteps are followin' me all night long",
"Spirits are callin' on me, something's wrong",
"Can't shake off my emotions, way too strong",
"Heart is underground, and I feel you all around",
"Everywhere I go, I'm haunted by your ghost",
"You stay on my mind, can't help but keep you close",
"Ooh, baby, everywhere I go, I'm haunted by your ghost",
"You're the one I loved, and I fear the most, ah-ah-ah",
"Keep havin' visions I can't control",
"I close my eyes just to feel your soul",
"It's in the air, and I think you know",
"That if I never stop, I might overdose",
"Footsteps are followin' me all night long",
"Spirits are callin' on me, something's wrong",
"Can't shake off my emotions, way too strong",

# Good Luck, Babe
"It's fine, it's cool",
"You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth",
"And guess I'm the fool",
"With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof",
"I don't wanna call it off",
"But you don't wanna call it love",
"You only wanna be the one that I call 'baby'",
"You can kiss a hundred boys in bars",
"Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling",
"You can say it's just the way you are",
"Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason",
"Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)",
"Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)",
"You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling",
"Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)",
"Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)",

"I'm clich√©, who cares?",
"It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair",
"And I cry, it's not fair",
"I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air",
"Think I'm gonna call it off",
"Even if you call it love",
"I just wanna love someone who calls me 'baby'",

"Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)",
"You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling",
"Ah, ah-yeah, oh",
"When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night",
"With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife",
"And when you think about me all of those years ago",
"You're standing face to face with 'I told you so'",
"You know I hate to say it, I told you so",
"You know I hate to say, but I told you so",
"You can kiss a hundred boys in bars",
"Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Well, I told you so)",
"You can say it's just the way you are",
"Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason",

# Greedy - Tae McRae
"He said, "Are you serious? I've tried, but I can't figure out"
"I've been next to you all night and still don't know what you're about"
"You keep ta- (ta-ta-), talkin', but not much comin' out your mouth"
"Can't you tell that I want you?" I say, "Yeah""
"I would want myself, baby, please believe me"
"I'll put you through hell just to know me, yeah, yeah"
"So sure of yourself, baby, don't get greedy"
"That shit won't end well, no, it won't end well"
"Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh (whoo)"
"I see you eyein' me down, but you'll never know much past my name"
"Or how I'm runnin' this room around and that I'm still half your age"
"Yeah, you're loo- (loo-loo-), lookin' at me like I'm some sweet escape"
"Obvious that you want me, but I said"
"I would want myself, baby, please believe me"
"I'll put you through hell just to know me, yeah, yeah"
"So sure of yourself, baby, don't get greedy"
"That shit won't end well, no, it won't end well"
"He said, "I'm just curious, is this for real or just an act?"
"Can't tell if you love or hate me, never met someone like that"
"Drive me so (so-so) crazy, did you know you got that effect?""
"I said, "Lemme check, yeah""
"I would want myself, baby, please believe me"
"I'll put you through hell just to know me, yeah, yeah"
"So sure of yourself, baby, don't get greedy"
"That shit won't end well, no, it won't end well"
"I would want myself (I would want myself)"
"(I would want myself)"
"Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh"
